# KDDI---Diabetes-Genetic-Risk-Detection-Challenge
By 2022, nearly 130 million people will be living with diabetes in China. 
The causes of diabetes in China are influenced by various factors such as lifestyle, ageing, urbanisation and family genetics. 
At the same time, people with diabetes tend to be younger. 
Diabetes can lead to cardiovascular, renal and cerebrovascular complications. 
Therefore, accurate diagnosis of individuals with diabetes is of great clinical importance. 
Early genetic risk prediction of diabetes will help prevent the onset of diabetes. 
According to the Chinese Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (2017 Edition), the diagnostic criteria for diabetes are having typical symptoms of diabetes (irritable and excessive drinking, polyuria, polyphagia, unexplained weight loss) and random intravenous plasma glucose ≥11.1mmol/L or fasting intravenous plasma glucose ≥7.0mmol/L or plasma 2h after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) load Glucose ≥ 11.1mmol/L.  In this competition, you will build a genetic risk prediction model for diabetes from a training dataset and then predict whether an individual in the test dataset has diabetes and join us in helping people with diabetes to solve this 'sweet problem'.
